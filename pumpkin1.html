            <p>*This delicious pumpkin cake is baked in a sheet pan. It's lightly spiced, very moist. <br>
               And great for potlucks. When cool, top with your favorite cream cheese frosting.</p>

                <li>2 cups canned pumpkin</li>

               <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 12x18-inch sheet pan.</li>
                <li>Sift flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt together in a large bowl; set aside.</li>
                <li>Beat sugar and oil together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until smooth. Blend in pumpkin and vanilla, then beat in eggs one at a time.
                    Gradually beat in flour mixture until just combined. Stir in walnuts; spread batter into the prepared sheet pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool.</li>
